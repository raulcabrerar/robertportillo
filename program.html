      <h1>The Revenue Architecture Program</h1>
      <p>We architect your revenue system â€” from traffic to conversion â€” so your website stops bleeding money and starts printing results.</p>
    </div>

  <main class="container">
    <section class="fadeIn">
      <p>You've just seen how powerful the <span class="highlight">12 Evergreen Revenue Breakthroughs</span> can be when applied intentionally.</p>
      <p>But you don't need another checklist.<br>
      You need a <strong>system</strong> â€” one that installs the breakthroughs, maintains them, and adapts as you grow.</p>
      <p><strong>That's what we do.</strong></p>

      <h2>What's Included:</h2>
      <p>We work with a small group of clients each month to install the full Revenue Architecture System, built on three critical pillars:</p>

      <div class="feature-section">
        <article class="feature-card fadeIn">
          <h3>1. Reimagined SEO</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>We attract qualified, high-intent traffic by deploying the Intent-Aligned Content Engine</li>
            <li>Clean up low-value content, build contextual authority, and spark branded search</li>
            <li>Focus on what actually converts, not vanity traffic spikes</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card fadeIn">
          <h3>2. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Apply the Empathy-Driven Communication System across your most critical pages</li>
            <li>Rewrite messaging to resonate with real user intent</li>
            <li>Improve UX flow, CTA clarity, and conversion paths using data and session insights</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

        <article class="feature-card fadeIn">
          <h3>3. Systemic Iteration & Tracking</h3>
          <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Set up the Clarity Dashboard to track revenue-critical SEO + CRO performance</li>
            <li>Create an experimentation cycle: hypothesis, test, measure, improve</li>
            <li>Identify and fix revenue leaks monthly â€” not annually</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </div>

      <h2>Who This Is For:</h2>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>You've outgrown hacks.</li>
        <li>You have traffic, a brand, maybe even loyal customers â€” but conversion is inconsistent and unpredictable.</li>
        <li>You want strategic alignment between your traffic engine and your revenue engine.</li>
        <li>You want a site that works harder than you do.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Happens Next:</h2>
      <p>We take on a limited number of clients per month to ensure deep focus and high ROI.</p>
